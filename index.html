        <p>You've been given a random target score. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount to your
            score. The amount each crystal holds is different each time you play.</p>

        <p>You win the game by reaching the exact target score without going over. Once your current surpasses the target
            score, you'll lose the game. Give it a go!</p>
